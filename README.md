# gatsbyjs-manage-list

To manage a list in GatsbyJS, you can use various state management libraries such as Redux or React Context API. Here's an example of how to manage a list using React Context API:

Create a new file called ListContext.js in your Gatsby project's src folder.

This code defines a new React context called ListContext and a provider component called ListProvider. The ListProvider component uses the useState hook to create a new state called list, which is an array of items. It also defines two functions called addToList and removeFromList to add and remove items from the list, respectively.

Wrap your Gatsby app's root component with the ListProvider component in the gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js files:

This code wraps the root element of your app with the ListProvider component so that the list state is available to all components in your app.

Create a new file called List.js in your Gatsby project's src folder. Add the following code to create a new React component that displays the list:

This code uses the useContext hook to access the list state and removeFromList function from the ListContext. It then renders the list as an unordered list, with a remove button for each item.

Create a new file called AddToList.js in your Gatsby project's src folder. Add the following code to create a new React component that allows the user to add items to the list:

This code uses the `useState` hook to create a new state called `item`, which represents the item to be added to the list. It also uses the `useContext` hook to access the `addToList` function from the `ListContext`. When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function adds the `item` to the list and clears the input field.

Finally, in your Gatsby app's pages, import the `List` and `AddToList` components and render them

This code creates a new page called ListPage and renders the List and AddToList components.

That's it! Now you should be able to manage a list in your Gatsby app using React Context API. Note that this is just one way to manage state in Gatsby; there are many other options, including Redux, MobX, and local component state.
